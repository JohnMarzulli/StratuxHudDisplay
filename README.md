# Stratux HUD Display

A simple, DIY, Head Up Display for StratuxHUD.

## Summary

This project aims to develop a display for the StratuxHUD. This is born out of a lack of consistently available projectors.

The project includes the 3D printer geometry, bill of materials, and assembly instructions.

## Printing the Case

You may print the case at any infill from 10% to 100%. You will need to enable supports for the main case due to the cable outlet.

Do not enable supports for lens holder.

The lens holder is designed at different hights to help fit your plane's dashboard. They simply slot into place. When you are comfortable with your choice, gluing the holder onto the main case is recommended.
